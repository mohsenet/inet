Dan and Sue are police officers in London. It is a Tuesday
morning, and Dan is angry.
Whats the m atter, Dan? Sue asks.
Look at this, Dan says. Every day som eone steals
money from people near the shops. We m ust stop th is.
Yes, of course, Sue says. But w ho is it?


There is a jogger, Dan says. Every day he runs near the
shops. Sometimes he runs into people. Perhaps he steals the
money.
OK , Sue says. Lets go to the shops. Perhaps we can see
this jogger.
They sit upstairs in a w indow over the shops. Dan has a
radio. They w atch the people in the street.
Look! Sue says. Theres the jogger!


The young man runs into an old woman, and she falls
down. The jogger puts his hand on the old womans arm.
Im sorry, he says. Can I help you? Heres your bag.
Then a young woman shouts at him. Dont run here!
she says. Its dangerous! Go aw ay!
The young m an runs away. Dan talks in his radio.
Quick! Stop him! Hes running up North Street!
A police car stops the young m an in North Street.


Are you OK now? Sue asks the old woman.
Yes, thank you. Where is that nice young woman? I
cant see her now .
Have you got all your money? Sue asks.
The old woman looks in her bag. No, I havent! My
moneys in my purse. But my purse isnt here!
OK Sue, Dan says. Lets talk to the jogger!


Who are you? Sue asks the young man.
My names Peter Jones. Why? Who are you?
Were police officers. Why do you go running past the
shops every day?
Why not? I like running.
OK , Dan says. Lets look for the money.
What money? Peter Jones asks. What are you talking
about? I never take money with me when I run .
Dan looks for the money but he cannot find any.


Can I go now ? Peter Jones asks.
OK , Dan says angrily. But dont come back!
Why not? Peter asks angrily. I live here! And Im not
doing anything wrong! He runs away.
What do we do now ? Sue asks. W here is the old
womans money, and her purse?
I dont know , says Dan. Somebody has it. But who?
